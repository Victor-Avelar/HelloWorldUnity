# HelloWorldUnity
The Purpose of this project is to get Unity WebGL to work on github pages.

Everything works: https://victor-avelar.github.io/HelloWorldUnity/index.html

The game is trivial with no end goal, ship can move out of bounds: 
- space bar to move ship foreward
- arrow keys to move
- w to shoot lasers
